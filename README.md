# Maze_Solving_Algo

The folder consists of a single Arduino Code for Maze Solving Rover.

INSTRUCTIONS AND TUTORIAL WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE AT INSTRUCTABLES

  CONTENTS OF THE CODE:-
   The .ino file contains a ready to go line follower and maze solving algorithm that can solve complex mazes and remember the paths, 
   can process the full path, determine the shortest route and manuever its way through it.
   
TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:-
  To test the arduino board, go to file-examples and upload and run the blink.ino sketch to see if its working.
